# nicheautocomplete
Requirements: 

● The autocomplete must render at least the “name” field of all elements returned from the web service.

● Upon selecting an element with the mouse, the page must navigate to the URL indicated by the “url” field returned for that element from the web service.

● The autocomplete must support keyboard interactions (Up and Down arrow key navigation of the list, Enter key selection of an element).

● The autocomplete’s visual appearance must be configurable using CSS; to demonstrate this, please include ​two​instances of the autocomplete with different visual styles.

Additional Notes:

● You can use any JavaScript libraries you’d like (such as Underscore or jQuery), but you must implement the autocomplete functionality yourself. Please do not use any pre-built components that provide autocomplete functionality.

● The example above from our site is just that - an example. Please feel free to incorporate or not incorporate any information returned from the web service into your display, and take any stylistic direction that appeals to you.

● The two different autocomplete instances should have identical html structure with the exception of CSS class names and execute identical JavaScript. In other words, the only difference between the two should be in style, not functionality.
